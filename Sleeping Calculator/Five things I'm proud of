Five things I'm proud of:

Firstly, one element of my program that I am particularly proud of, is the ability to understand how to restrict Entry box inputs. Although I did derive much of the code from the website cited in my program, I interpreted the code, and changed it so that it would work with my program. The validate class contained many more complicated code elements, which I am proud to have utilized properly to make a great product.

Secondly, I am proud of my ability to understand and use matplotlib in order to create my line graph. I spent a longe time properly learning how to create the line graph, then I researched how to implement it in to a GUI program, which was more comlicated. Overall, I am happy with the outcome.

Furthermore, I am satisfied with my ability to use images in buttons and as independent labels. This element of my program looks very aesthetically pleasing, and is one that I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with. 

Fourthly, I am proud of my use of buttons to have a similar function to checkboxes. Overall, when creating my colour change section, I did not want to use a checkbox because it appeared too small on my GUI.
